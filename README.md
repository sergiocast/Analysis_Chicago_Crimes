📊 Chicago Crime Data Analysis (2010–2019)

This project analyzes crime data from the city of Chicago between the years 2010 and 2019 using Python (Pandas) in a Jupyter Notebook, and visualizes trends in a dynamic Tableau dashboard. The goal is to identify patterns in crime over time, by type and location, and provide accessible visual insights based on official public data.
